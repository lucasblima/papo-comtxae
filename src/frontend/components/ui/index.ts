/**
 * UI Components Barrel File
 * 
 * This file re-exports all UI component from the ui directory.
 * Import UI components from this file to avoid direct imports from component files.
 * 
 * Example:
 * import { Button, Card, GlobalErrorBoundary, ThemeToggle, ErrorBoundary } from '../components/ui';
 */

export * from './Toast';
export { ThemeToggle } from './ThemeToggle';
export * from './AchievementNotification';
export { GlobalErrorBoundary, ErrorBoundary, withErrorBoundary } from './GlobalErrorBoundary';
// Add other UI component exports here as they are created
